This is for keeping my understaning of pandas and matplotlib fresh in my mind. The purpose of this is to show a scatter plot of my fuel cost based on Fuel Price and total gallons and total gas cost and gallons.

For the python apps to run successfully please install pandas and matplotlib.

pip install pandas 
pip install matplotlib.

Thank you for viewing.
